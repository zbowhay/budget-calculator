## Budget Calculator

This project was built for a [coding challenge](https://gist.github.com/cowabungapeppercorn/cc851d881565ed90f08a54927d7f80bb).  Although I had/have little to no experience with React at the time of writing this, I thought it would be fun to go ahead and challenge myself to use it.  Aaand there's definitely a lot to learn!

For fun I threw in a little easter egg too.  Can you find it?
